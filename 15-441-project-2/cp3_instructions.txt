Setup:
    Place sender.c and reciever.c in src/
    score_calculator.py and test_20MB_file go in the top-level directory (i.e. in 15441-project-2/)
    Edit your Makefile to compile both sender.c and receiver.c

Running score calculator:
    On server VM run: (./reciever 441 &) && (./receiver 641 &) 
    On client VM run: sudo python3 score_calculator.py

Manually removing executables:
    Note that all executables SHOULD exit by themselves.
    To manually kill receivers: pkill -f receiver (on server VM)
    To manually kill senders: sudo tmux kill-server (on client VM)
